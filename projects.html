      <p class="project-summary-description">As a Front-End Developer, also known as a Client-Side Developer, I utilize my knowledge and experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as SEO, Hosting and API,  to design and develop websites and web applications so that you and your client can not only see them, but interact and use them as well. </p>
<p class="project-summary-highlighted">It is my job to capture your vision and bring it to life. </p>
<p class="project-summary-description">I have included a few of my most recent projects below to showcase my knowledge and experience. I hope you enjoy and I look forward to working together so that we can bring your vision to the screen.</p>

<p class="weather2-summary">My latest project.  Using a combination of CSS, HTML, API, and Javascript, I was able to create a weather application that can be used seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. </br></br>The ability to build an app that reported the weather in a current location, as well as for hundreds of cities around the world, was challenging and gratifying.  It gave me the confidence to continue furthering my education and knowledge base. </p>

<div class="row weather-original">
<div class="col">
<p class="weather-summary">This was my first project combining my advancing CSS and HTML skills with my newly acquired Javascript and API knowledge.  As I became more confident, it evolved from a very basic design into one with a little more personality.  The sense of accomplishment pushed me to design another one to ensure I understood how to efficiently apply all of the concepts. </p></div>

<p class="hiking-summary">This was my very first attempt at designing a single page static webpage using HTML and CSS.  I had previously dabbled with blogging websites that provided templates and the necessary code.  </br></br>This project started as a blank page staring back at me just waiting for me to transform it into something useful. </br></br>And, for my first attempt, I was pretty proud of my creation and was excited to continue moving forth with my education to see what else I could learn.  </p></div>
