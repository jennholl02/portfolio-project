            Hello, I’m Jenn, an aspiring Front-End Developer. Originally from
            Western New York, and after living in and experiencing several
            different states across the U.S over the past 20 years, I have
            settled in the beautiful state of Colorado and am based in the
            Denver metro area.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the past 24 years, I have worked as an Occupational Therapist,
            primarily serving the older adult population. The aspect I love most
            about my job is helping others find the best solutions for their
            current situation so that they can live a happy and fulfilled life.
            I am now taking that passion of helping others and applying it to
            the world of Front-End Development. I have always had an interest in
            technology and I am excited to see where this new adventure takes
            me. There’s a solution for every problem and I love the lightbulb
            moments when it all comes together!
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m not working as a therapist or advancing my development
            knowledge, you can find me hiking/backpacking with my husband,
            hammocking with a good book, throwing a frisbee for Olive, our
            Border Collie, paddleboarding, knitting a basket, hunting for new
            recipes or learning new things like wood-burning.  I hope you stick
            around and enjoy the ride with me!

            These are two of the core foundations for building a website. HTML
            is used for creating the skeleton, the outline of the webpage(s),
            while CSS is used for the visual styling of the page(s) through the
            integration of colors, fonts, sizing, spacing, etc.

          <p class="skills-heading">JAVASCRIPT</p>
          <p class="skills-description">
            Quite simply, Javascript is a programming language that enables
            dynamic behavior, on both the user and server side. In other words,
            it allows the webpage(s) to be interactive and come to life.

          <p class="skills-heading">SEO</p>
          <p class="skills-description">
            Short for Search Engine Optimization. By choosing the ideal titles
            and descriptions for each webpage, as well as designing for static
            and mobile devices, your online content is optimized for targeted
            traffic through organic search engine results, thus catching the
            attention of your desired visitors.

          <p class="skills-heading">API/HOSTING</p>
          <p class="skills-description">
            Short for Application Programming Interface. This allows
            applications to talk to each other and exchange necessary data,
            easily and securely, so that your desired outcome is achieved. Think
            of it as a middleman. Every time you use an app to check the
            weather, to send a message or to check on a football score, you are
            using an API.
